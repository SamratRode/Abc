Hi,
As discussed with you and (manager), due to a family/health (jo wording pehle use ki) emergency, medicine I will be working from Gurgaon for a short interim period from 7th May to 17th May 2024. As discussed with (manager) I will greatly appreciate if these days could be marked as marker days for the time being.
I will also try to provide any supporting documents, though difficult, within the same period. And as per our discussion, I will make sure if any future case like this arises in the coming weeks (after this visit), I will have any such documentation handy with me first.

As the situation is not predicable, I am unsure of when my next visit to Gurgaon could be after next week.  If any such situation does arise, I will make sure to communicate all related information in advance.

I truly appreciate all the support I have recieved till now

Thanks,
Samrat
